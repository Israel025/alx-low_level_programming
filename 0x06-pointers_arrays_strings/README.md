** The 0-strcat.c function program concatenates two strings. Returns a pointer to the resulting string dest.

** The 1-strncat.c function program concatenates two strings. it will use at most n bytes from src; and src does not need to be null-terminated if it contains n or more bytes. Return a pointer to the resulting string dest.

** The 2-strncpy.c function program copies a string. works exactly like strncpy.

** The 3-strcmp.c function program compares two strings. Works exactly like strncpy.

** The 4-rev_array.c function program reverses the content of an array of integers.

** The 5-string_toupper.c function program changes all lowercase letters of a string to uppercase.

** The 6-cap_string.c function program capitalizes all words of a string. Separators of words: space, tabulation, new line, ,, ;, ., !, ?, ", (, ), {, and }.

** The 7-leet.c function program encodes a string into 1337(leet). making use of only one if statement, only use two loops, no switch statement and no ternary operation. using the below encoding:
    Letters a and A should be replaced by 4
    Letters e and E should be replaced by 3
    Letters o and O should be replaced by 0
    Letters t and T should be replaced by 7
    Letters l and L should be replaced by 1.
