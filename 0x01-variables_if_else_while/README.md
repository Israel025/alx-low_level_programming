** The 0-positive_or_negative.c program completes the source code in order to print whether the number stored in the variable n is positive or negative.

** The 1-last_digit.c program Complete the source code in order to print the last digit of the number stored in the variable n. with the following output:
    The string Last digit of, followed by
    n, followed by
    the string is, followed by
        if the last digit of n is greater than 5: the string and is greater than 5
        if the last digit of n is 0: the string and is 0
        if the last digit of n is less than 6 and not 0: the string and is less than 6 and not 0
    followed by a new line.

** The 2-print_alphabet.c program prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line. using only the putchar function, all code is in the main function. (couls only use putchar twice in your code).

** The 3-print_alphabets.c program prints the alphabet in lowercase, and then in uppercase, followed by a new line. using only the putchar function, all code is in the main function. (could only use putchar 3x in your code).
